## Getting Started

This project requires Visual Studio and the .NET Framework to be installed.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the solution file (WinFormsApp2.sln) in Visual Studio.
3. Run the application (press F5) to see the form with the current time displayed.

## Next Steps

The provided code serves as a basic structure. You can extend it by:

* Adding functionality to the `timer1_Tick` event handler. This could involve updating the time on the label or performing other tasks at regular intervals.
* Implementing additional controls and features on the form using the Visual Studio designer.
